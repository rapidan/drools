/**
 * <p>
 * The KnowlegeAgent is created by the KnowlegeAgentFactory. The KnowlegeAgent provides automatic loading, caching and 
 * re-loading, of resources and is configured from a properties files. The KnowledgeAgent can update or rebuild this KnowlegeBase 
 * as the resources it uses are changed. The strategy for this is determined by the configuration given to the factory, but it is 
 * typically pull based using regular polling. We hope to add push based updates and rebuilds in future versions.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Following example constructs an agent that will build a new KnowledgeBase from the files specified in the path String.
 * It will poll those files every 60 seconds, which is the default when polling is enabled and the service started, to see if they are updated. 
 * If new files are found it will construct a new KnowledgeBase. If the change set specifies a resource that is a directory it's contents will be scanned for changes  too.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * KnowledgeAgent kagent = KnowledgeAgentFactory.newKnowledgeAgent( "MyAgent" );
 * kagent.applyChangeSet( ResourceFactory.newUrlResource( url ) );
 * KnowledgeBase kbase = kagent.getKnowledgeBase();    
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>If you wish to change to change the polling time of the scanner, this can be done with the ResourceChangeScannerService on the ResourceFactory</p>
 * <pre>
 * // Set the interval on the ResourceChangeScannerService if the default of 60s is not desirable.
 * ResourceChangeScannerConfiguration sconf = ResourceFactory.getResourceChangeScannerService().newResourceChangeScannerConfiguration();
 * sconf.setProperty( "drools.resource.scanner.interval",
 *                    "30" ); // set the disk scanning interval to 30s, default is 60s
 * ResourceFactory.getResourceChangeScannerService().configure( sconf );
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>The KnowledgeAgent can accept a configuration that allows for some of the defaults to be changed, see KnowledgeAgentConfiguration for details of 
 * all the support configuration properties. An example property is "drools.agent.scanDirectories", by default any specified directories are 
 * scanned for new additions, it is possible to disable this.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();
 *
 * KnowledgeAgentConfiguration kaconf = KnowledgeAgentFactory.newKnowledgeAgentConfiguration();
 * kaconf.setProperty( "drools.agent.scanDirectories",
 *                     "false" ); // we do not want to scan directories, just files
 *       
 * KnowledgeAgent kagent = KnowledgeAgentFactory.newKnowledgeAgent( "test agent", // the name of the agent
 *                                                                  kaconf );
 * kagent.applyChangeSet( ResourceFactory.newUrlResource( url ) ); // resource to the change-set xml for the resources to add
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You'll notice the property "drools.agent.newInstance", which defaults to true, currently this cannot be set to false. This property when
 * true means the KnowledgeBase will be rebuilt as a new instance when changes are detected and that new instance will be available when
 * kagent.getKnowledgeBase() is next called. We hope to add incremental KnowledgeBase support in the future, when a "false" value will be supported
 * for this property.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * KnowledgeAgents can take a empty KnowledgeBase or a populated one. If a populated KnowledgeBase is provided, the KnowledgeAgent
 * will iterate KnowledgeBase and subscribe to the Resource that it finds. While it is possible for the KnowledgeBuilder to build
 * all resources found in a directory, that information is lost by the KnowledgeBuilder so those directories will not be continuously scanned.
 * Only directories specified as part of the applyChangeSet(Resource) method are monitored.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Resource scanning is not on by default, it's a service and must be started, the same is for notification. This can be done via the ResourceFactory.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ResourceFactory.getResourceChangeNotifierService().start();
 * ResourceFactory.getResourceChangeScannerService().start();
 * </pre>
