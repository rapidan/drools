Features for integration of ODE in Drools Flow

 - BPEL processes + other required files (WSDLs, config files, etc.) can be added to the knowledge base
   * Loose or tight integration?
   * Including changeset.xml
 
 - validation of BPEL processes on addition to the knowledge base
 
 - BPEL processes can be started using the Knowledge API
   * Loose or tight integration? 
 
 - BPEL process instances can be monitored using the Knowledge API
   * Loose or tight integration?
 
 - Events emitted by the BPEL engine are integrated with the Drools eventing system
   * Loose or tight integration?
 
 - BPEL Eclipse editor integrated with Drools Eclipse IDE
 
 - BPEL engine integrated into JBoss ESB
 
 - BPEL processes are integrated with the console / BAM
 
 - BPEL processes + other required files (WSDLs, config files, etc.) can be stored on Guvnor
 
 - Integration of persistence / transaction mechanisms
 
 - Extend ODE with rule integration features

 - Example that shows the integration of BPEL and Flow processes:
   - RuleFlow process invokes BPEL process
   - Event log shows integrated event log of both BPEL and RuleFlow
   - BPEL and RuleFlow processes on Guvnor
   - BPEL and RuleFlow processes on console / BAM
   - Integration with ESB
