Download latest Drools code from SVN: http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/labs/labs/jbossrules/trunk/

Run Drools build: in Drools root folder run "mvn -Dmaven.test.skip -Declipse install"
(if it is the first time you do this, this could take a while as it will be downloading eclipse as part of the installation, you can remove the -Declipse part if you're not interested in the Eclipse plugin)

Download and install JBoss AS version 4.2.3.GA
In install/build.xml, change <property name="jboss.home" value="C:/jboss-4.2.3.GA" /> to the location of your JBoss AS installation

Increase the memory that can be used by the application server (especially the PermGen space). To do so,
On linux: 
  edit the run.conf in your JBoss AS bin folder and add the following line at the end of the file:
  JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
On windows: 
  edit the run.bat in your JBoss AS bin folder and change the following line:
  set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Xms128m -Xmx512m
  to
  set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Xms128m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
